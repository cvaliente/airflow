This version of Docker Provider has a new feature - TaskFlow decorator that only works in Airflow 2.2.

.. code-block:: text

    AttributeError: '_TaskDecorator' object has no attribute 'docker'

2.1.0
.....

Features
~~~~~~~~

* ``Adds option to disable mounting temporary folder in DockerOperator (#16932)``

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* ``[FIX] Docker provider - retry docker in docker (#17061)``
* ``fix string encoding when using xcom / json (#13536)``
* if ``xcom_all`` is set to ``False``, only the last line of the log (separated by ``\n``) will be
  included in the XCom value

The ``DockerOperator`` in version 2.0.0 did not work for remote Docker Engine or Docker-In-Docker case.
That was an unintended side effect of #15843 that has been fixed in #16932. There is a fallback mode
which will make Docker Operator works with warning and you will be able to remove the warning by
using the new parameter to disable mounting the folder.

2.0.0
.....

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Auto-apply apply_default decorator (#15667)``

.. warning:: Due to apply_default decorator removal, this version of the provider requires Airflow 2.1.0+.
   If your Airflow version is < 2.1.0, and you want to install this provider version, first upgrade
   Airflow to at least version 2.1.0. Otherwise your Airflow package version will be upgraded
   automatically and you will have to manually run ``airflow upgrade db`` to complete the migration.

* ``Replace DockerOperator's 'volumes' arg for 'mounts' (#15843)``

The ``volumes`` parameter in
``airflow.providers.docker.operators.docker.DockerOperator`` and
``airflow.providers.docker.operators.docker_swarm.DockerSwarmOperator``
was replaced by the ``mounts`` parameter, which uses the newer
`mount syntax <https://docs.docker.com/storage/>`__ instead of ``--bind``.
